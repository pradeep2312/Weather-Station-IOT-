# Weather-Station-IOT-
In recent years we have seen increased interest in air purifiers and weather applications. The system can be defined as a mechanism for determining the ppm levels and weather accurately. We rely heavily on the weather and particle sensor to accurately measure the required parameters and also to display and store this using MQTT and GCP servers for further analysis.
So, our main motivation is to implement a system which can monitor weather and particles (PPM) in any environment.
